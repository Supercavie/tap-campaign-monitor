Hello everyone, is it possible to add all the subscribers history of campaign monitor to Tables. On campaign monitor you have the API:

https://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/subscribers/#getting-subscribers-history

That's the only way Campaign Monitor API has, to give you all the details of journeys. Apart from campaigns and lists, you can on 
Campaign Monitor create Journeys to automatically send emails to a subscriber segmented list.

This tap-campaign-monitor has been awesome and allows a third party like stitchdata to send all the campaign monitor data automatically 
to Google BigQuery, it is just missing this part of information.

Can you please help?
Thanks,
Diogo.
